        <h3>Our Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action
          behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a
          little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young, global
          fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for
          own sake, but for all future generations to come. Since day one, we
          have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon footprint to an
          absolute minimum as well as making conscious decisions concerning the
          social impact on the communities in the countries, in which we
          operate. As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”.
          We believe that this small change further represents a new and greener
          future for SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products
          in better materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will
          start implementing more conscious initiatives within the company, and
          we hope that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as we are
          all in this together! As a company with great manufacturing
          activities, we know that we have a responsibility. Our focus is to
          make as green a production as possible, and we will continue to launch
          new initiatives to lower our carbon footprint even further. Read our
          principles below.
