        <h3>WORKING CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>
          At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning
          obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but
          also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that
          it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct
          within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the
          ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
          suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our
          factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put
          their children in school. Team Silfen provides insurance to all our
          hard-working employees as well as their family. Our factories also
          grant pensions to all employees, providing them with financial
          stability after retirement. We support the different religions of
          employees and protect their right to engage with rituals, prayers etc.
          at any time. We condemn discrimination, and make sure that the
          employees are protected from prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
          We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
          issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution
          etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is
          always crafted in a responsible manner. All our manufacturers are
          SA8000 certified.

        <h3>COTTON</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly known
          as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from eco-friendly
          or organic cotton. Both materials require far less water consumption
          than conventional cotton products. Every nylon product is made from
          eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey from raw material to
          SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as possible.

        <h3>LEATHER</h3>
        <p>
          All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf leather
          and is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that every part of
          the animal is utilized in various industries. We love colors and new
          trends, but we incorporate consciousness and quality in our design
          processes to retain timelessness in all products. All our components,
          zippers, thread, reinforcement, glue etc., are made from high-quality
          raw materials. We encourage our customers to take good care of their
          bag, prolonging the life of the product. By caring for your bag, you
          will be able to create more experiences with it – an important factor
          in creating a more sustainable, mindful business.
